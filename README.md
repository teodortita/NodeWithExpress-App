# NodeWithExpress-App
Personal Project

## Description

I have developed a web application that is built upon Node.js and ExpressJS. The project illustrates a minimalist blog with its posts and a form for adding more posts. This project can be run entirely standalone, as it is not dependent upon any database collections (all blog entries are stored in an array of objects in the .js file). There is also a validation system implemented, such that all fields have to be filled in order for the user to submit the form. I have used a mobile-first design pattern.
