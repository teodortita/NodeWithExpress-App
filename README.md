# NodeWithExpress-App

Personal Project

## Description

I have developed a web application that is built using Node.js and Express.js. The project represents a minimalist blog with its posts and a form for adding more posts. This project can be run entirely standalone, as it is not dependent upon any database collections (all blog posts are stored in an array of objects in the .js file). I have implemented form validation in Express.js and the user-interface is implemented in a mobile-first design pattern.
